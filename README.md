# VR Application in Java

This is a simple Virtual Reality (VR) application built using Java and the jMonkeyEngine library. The application creates a basic 3D scene that can serve as a starting point for developing VR experiences.

## Features

- Displays a 3D box in a virtual environment.
- Demonstrates how to set up a basic scene using jMonkeyEngine.
- Provides a structure for further development of VR applications in Java.

## Getting Started

To run the application, make sure you have Java and Maven installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to compile and execute the application:

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.MyVRApplication"

```

1. The application window should open, displaying the 3D scene with a blue box.

## Dependencies

- jMonkeyEngine: A 3D game engine for Java, used for rendering the virtual environment and handling graphics.

## Usage

Feel free to modify and expand upon this codebase to create your own VR experiences. You can add new 3D models, implement interactive elements, or integrate with VR hardware for a more immersive experience.
